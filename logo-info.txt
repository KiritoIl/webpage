Iron Throne Logo Instructions:

1. Save the Iron Throne image you provided as "logo.png" in this directory
2. The website is already configured to use it as a small logo at the top
3. Recommended size: 80x80 pixels or similar small size
4. The image will be automatically styled with the dark theme

Note: Since I cannot directly save images from user uploads, please save your Iron Throne image as "logo.png" in this folder.
